### Contemplation on the Concept of a Basis

Clearly the notion of a basis in Linear Algebra and Topology has some things in common and some things very distinct.
At least one author of a Linear Algebra text took unique representability to be the definition of a basis, whereas there is no such property for a basis for a topology as Munkres comments.
Any given topology can be generated by distinct bases, and probably more apt for the analogy, in a given basis a given open set can (I believe) be generated by distinct choices of basis "elements".
But the two notions do share the idea that in a sense a given basis is "the minimal collection of stuff needed to put things together in a natural way, in order to recover the whole space of stuff".

(By the way, is anybody else a little uneasy with the terminology of "basis element" when the basis is itself a set?
I know sets can be elements, of course, but in using this vocabulary I always have to spend a second getting my barings straight about whether the element is an element of the topology or an element out of the set of basis elements.
I think I would prefer the phrase "a base" to talk about some "basis element".)

### Exercise 2.13.1.
Let $X$ be a topological space, and let $A \subset X$.
Suppose that for each $x \in A$ there is an open set $U$ containing $x$ such that $U \subset A$.
Then $A$ is the union of all such subsets $U$ and, being the union of open sets, is open.
