### Comment on Definition of Topology

According to Lee's *Introduction to Topological Manifolds*, the main idea behind the current definition of *topology* is the open-subset criterion for continuity: It provides a simple way to detect continuous maps knowing only the open subsets of both spaces, unburdened by extraneous details.
Aside from that, choosing open subsets allows one to qualitatively describe "nearness" instead of using quantitative measures like distance in Euclidean space.
We simply put the subset $A \subset X$ containing $x$ to be the neighborhood of $x$, and something is "near" $x$ if it is in every neighborhood of $x$.
