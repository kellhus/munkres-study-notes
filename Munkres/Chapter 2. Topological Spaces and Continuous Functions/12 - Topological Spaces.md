### Comment on Definition of Topology

According to Lee's *Introduction to Topological Manifolds*, the main idea behind the current definition of *topology* is the open-subset criterion for continuity: It provides a simple way to detect continuous maps knowing only the open subsets of both spaces, unburdened by extraneous details.
Aside from that, choosing open subsets allows one to qualitatively work with "nearness" of elements of a space instead of using purely quantitative measures like the Euclidean distance in Euclidean space, which may be cumbersome or insufficient for our purposes.
We simply put the open subset $A \subseteq X$ containing $x$ to be the neighborhood of $x$, and something is "near" $x$ if it is in every neighborhood of $x$.
Depending on which topology we choose with respect to whatever viewpoint we want to adopt, $\mathcal T_1$ or $\mathcal T_2$, our "nearness" becomes qualitatively different.
According to Brown's *Topology and Groupoids*, topological spaces may be axiomatized in terms of other structures: Closed sets, closure, interior, the relation $A \subseteq \operatorname{Int} B$, etc.
These axiomatizations are entirely equivalent to the open-set axiomatization.
